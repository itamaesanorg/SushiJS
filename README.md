### Introducing Next Right Now 2 (NRNx2)

NRN2 is the evolution of Next Right Now, a framework that introduced the Numerical Reference Number (NRN) system to manage directory identification. This system is now integrated into SushiJS.

## Introduction to Common Internet Language also CIL

CIL is a facilitator to name errors and organize your project, to enumerate folders into a web dynamic project, to ensure a faster, reliable, and efficient identification for:

- Fast Error enclave communication.
- Fast Error identification
- Easy Dev to Dev communication language
- Efficient shortened name of high paths of files

E.g.,

```tsx
./ui/uncommon/02 Body/03 Carrousel/index.ts:1:10
```

It converts into CIL, the answer is:

```rs
uu0203-1:10
```

With the introduction of SushiJS, we've solved many challenges, making the development process quicker, more straightforward, and universally understandable between devs and non-devs. This includes project managers who understand coding basics but aren't deeply involved in the project's intricate file structures.

## NRNx2 Agile by ITAMAESAN

SushiJS introduced the NRNx2 Agile subsystem folder structure and development methodology. 

The second main feature of The SushiJS Framework is the ability to create components that are reusable but not necessarily general for all the pages. This is the reason why we have created the "uncommon" folder. This folder is part of the framework, and it is an extra way create components that are not general for all the pages. It contains, the same strcuture until you navigate to the "elements" folder, and the order of the imports is customizable 100% by the developer.

 - ui/common/
 - ui/uncommon/

NRNx2 Agile is a project management methodology that combines the best of Agile and Waterfall. It's a hybrid approach that allows for more flexibility and control over the development process.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone [repository_link]
npm install
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import Appbar from 'ui/uncommon/03_Body/13_Appbar'
```

### Folder Structure

```bash
- ui/common/
- ui/uncommon/
```

Delve deeper into folders like:
- 00 Header
- 01 Head
- 02 Body
- 03 Footer

> The "uncommon" directory is there for specialized components tailored for specific pages.

## Why NRNx2

NRN stands for Next Right Now, and x2 symbolizes the integration of SushiJS Agile. This framework introduced a Numerical Reference Number (NRN) system to manage directory identification.
