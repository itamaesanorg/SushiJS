For everypage, there could be something not in common, but still in use. For that, we will use the uncommon directory, to specify repetitive components, that are not used in specififc folders but not on every page.
Path: src/uncommon/ by pages, in this example, 02 404 Error / in this case we modified, 00 Header so, 00 Header/00 Meta/00 Meta.tsx as a final result: 

Path: src/uncommon/02 404 Error/00 Header/00 Meta/
Path: src/uncommon/02 404 Error/00 Header/00 Meta/00 Index.ts
Path: src/uncommon/02 404 Error/00 Header/00 Meta/00 Meta.tsx

By default, we have the following directories:
01 Head
02 Body
03 Footer
With no files inside.
